# exercism-python
Exercism katas for python

## Using Python 3.5 from anaconda - continuum analytics
My python environment is managed with the excellent conda and I'm using nose to continuously run my tdd, in a split terminal view, with `nosetests --with-watch` alongside vim. 

## Getting started

To begin with download the appropriate distribution of [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) for your machine.

Then recreate my python tdd environment by first cloning this repo,
```
  git clone git@github.com:willjharmer/exercism-python.git
  cd exercism-python
```
then recreate my conda env
```
  conda create --file environment.yml
```
and you're all set.
